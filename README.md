Synapse is a Builder's Paradise !!

Being someone who loves to build things, just in the spirit or learning, cultivating a sense of acceleration is something that I always wanted to do - and Synapse is a way to celebrate this.
Synapse is a platform that can be used by any community as a forum. I made it for my college, so that students, professors, PhD students can showcase their work, get validation on their idea and generally keep up to date with what's happening in the campus.\
It is made by keepin Hackernews as reference, and many thing will be same as that.

## Help Needed.
I'm not a WebDeveloper, however, I still managed to do most of the stuff because I know Flask. Open sourcing this project is a way for me to make this into something awesome.

Always open for ideas. Please raise a PR, and we'll get to work.
